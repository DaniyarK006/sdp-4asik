INTRODUCTION

The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that separates abstraction and its implementation so that they can be modified independently. This solves the problem of combinatorial class explosion when supporting multiple variations of functionality.

Project Goal: Demonstrate the application of the Bridge pattern using a document rendering system for various formats (HTML, Markdown, Plain Text).

Tasks:
- Implement a document hierarchy (Article, Resume, Book)
- Create different renderers for output formats
- Demonstrate the ability to dynamically change renderers
- Demonstrate the flexibility and extensibility of the system

PATTERN STRUCTURE

Main Components:

1. Implementor (Renderer) - an interface defining basic rendering operations:
```java
public interface Renderer {
void renderTitle(String title);
void renderText(String text);
void renderImage(String image);
void renderLink(String url, String text);
}
```

2. Concrete Implementors - concrete implementations:
- `HtmlRenderer` - formatting in HTML tags
- `MarkdownRenderer` - formatting in Markdown syntax
- `PlainTextRenderer` - plain text representation

3. Abstraction (Document) - an abstract class with a reference to the Renderer:
```java
public abstract class Document {
protected Renderer renderer;

protected Document(Renderer renderer) {
this.renderer = renderer;
}

public void setRenderer(Renderer renderer) {
this.renderer = renderer;
}

public abstract void render();
}
```

4. Refined Abstractions - specific document types:
- `Article` - article with title, author, and content
- `Resume` - resume with name, email, and work experience
- `Book` - book with cover, ISBN, and description

---

USAGE

Creating documents with different renderers:

```java
// Creating renderers
Renderer htmlRenderer = new HtmlRenderer();
Renderer markdownRenderer = new MarkdownRenderer();

// Creating an article with HTML rendering
Article article = new Article(
htmlRenderer,
"Design Patterns",
"John Doe",
"Content here..."
);
article.render(); // Output to HTML

// Change the renderer to Markdown
article.setRenderer(markdownRenderer);
article.render(); // The same document in Markdown
```

Example output:

HTML format:
```html
<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<p>Author: John Doe</p>
<p>Content here...</p>
```

Markdown format:
```markdown
# Design Patterns
Author: John Doe
Content here...
```

IMPLEMENTATION ADVANTAGES

1. Flexibility
- Any document can use any renderer
- The renderer can be changed at runtime

2. Extensibility
- Easily add a new document type (e.g., Invoice)
- Easily add a new format (e.g., PDF, JSON)
- No need to change existing code

3. Avoiding Duplication
- Without Bridge: 3 documents x 3 formats = 9 classes
- With Bridge: 3 documents + 3 renderers = 6 classes

4. Adherence to SOLID principles
- Single Responsibility: each class is responsible for a single task
- Open/Closed: open for extension, closed for modification
- Dependency Inversion: depend on abstractions, not concrete classes

---

CONCLUSION

This project demonstrates the practical application of the Bridge pattern for creating a flexible document rendering system. Key achievements:

✓ An extensible architecture with separation of abstraction and implementation was created.
✓ Three document types and three output formats were implemented.
✓ The ability to dynamically change renderers was demonstrated.
✓ Adherence to clean code principles was demonstrated.

The Bridge pattern is especially useful in systems that require supporting multiple combinations of functionality. It makes code more modular, understandable, and maintainable, which is critical for scalable applications.
